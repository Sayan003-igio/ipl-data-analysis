## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth data analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to derive insights about teams, players, match outcomes, and overall trends across seasons. Using Python and data science libraries, we explore various performance metrics and visualize key findings.

## **Data Source**

* The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle - IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulbhalley/ipl-complete-dataset-2008-2022).
* It includes:

  * `matches.csv` – summary of all IPL matches.
  * `deliveries.csv` – ball-by-ball details of every match.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualization

---

## **Analysis Performed**

* Total matches, seasons, and teams played
* Team-wise match wins and performance
* Toss impact on match outcomes
* Top players with most 'Player of the Match' awards
* Venue analysis: Most matches hosted and wins
* Total runs scored per season
* Batsmen and bowlers performance analysis

---

## **Key Insights**

* Mumbai Indians are the most successful team in terms of wins.
* Winning the toss sometimes impacts the final result, depending on venue and conditions.
* Certain players consistently perform across multiple seasons.
* Some venues offer strong home advantage.
